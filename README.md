This is a simple animation of moving through space between stars, accompanied by a screen-shake effect to enhance the sense of movement.


Parallax effect:
  The stars move at different speeds depending on their distance from the viewer, creating a 3D-like illusion of depth.
  The speed at which we move is changed in real-time based on the length of the username entered.


Screen-shake effect:
  The camera shakes slightly to simulate the turbulence of interstellar space and give a more dynamic feel to the animation.
  The Turbulence is changed in real-time based on the length of the password entered.
